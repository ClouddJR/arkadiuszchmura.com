## Introduction

In this post, I will show you how to make an expandable text that is controlled by a button below it using Jetpack Compose. Additionally, we'll introduce some simple animations to make the text state changes a bit nicer and add an ellipsis at the end of the text to indicate that it has overflowed.

That's the final result we'll be implementing:

{{< figure
width=350
align=center
src="/expandable/final.gif"
>}}

## Solution

Let's start with the following snippet and build on top of it:

```kotlin
class MainActivity : ComponentActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

        setContent {
            MyAppTheme {
                Surface(
                    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize(),
                    color = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.background
                ) {
                    ExpandableText(
                        modifier = Modifier.padding(16.dp)
                    )
                }
            }
        }
    }


```

You get that snippet after creating a new project using Android Studioâ€™s project wizard. The only change I introduced is that I added the `ExpandableText` composable that we'll be building.

First, let's add a `Text` and `TextButton` composables (wrapped in a `Column`) inside our new `ExpandableText` composable:

```kotlin
@Composable
private fun ExpandableText(modifier: Modifier) {
    Column(
        modifier = modifier
    ) {
        Text(
            text = "Hello World! ".repeat(50),
            maxLines = 5,
            overflow = TextOverflow.Ellipsis
        )
        
        TextButton(
            onClick = { },
            modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth(),
            shape = RectangleShape
        ) {
            Text(
                text = "Expand".uppercase()
            )
        }
    }
}

```

I am passing a modifier as a parameter to the `ExpandableText` to be able to control it from the outside. 

Inside, I am setting the text to "Hello World! " repeated 50 times to make sure it overflows. Also, I'm limiting the number of lines to 5 and passing `TextOverflow.Ellipsis` to the `overflow` parameter to use an ellipsis when the text overflows (by default, it just clips the text).

The `TextButton` below is set to fill the entire width and has a `RectangleShape` because it looks more appropriate in this case than the default, rounded shape.

This is what we have so far:

{{< figure
width=350
align=center
src="/expandable/overflow.png"
>}}

Next, let's implement the `onClick` for our `TextButton`. When clicking, we want to remove the limit of 5 lines for the text (so that it expands) and change the text for the button from "Expand" to "Collapse". 

For that, we will introduce a mutable state variable called `isExpanded` that will be toggled inside the `onClick` and control the parameters mentioned above like this:

```kotlin
@Composable
private fun ExpandableText(modifier: Modifier) {
    var isExpanded by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }

    // ...
    Text(
        // ...
        maxLines = if (isExpanded) Int.MAX_VALUE else 5,
    )

    TextButton(
        // ...
        onClick = { isExpanded = !isExpanded },
    ) {
        Text(
            text = (if (isExpanded) "Collapse" else "Expand").uppercase()
        )
    }
}

```

After those changes, expanding and collapsing works properly:

{{< figure
width=350
align=center
src="/expandable/no_animation.gif"
>}}

But there is one problem with our implementation. What happens when the text is shorter than 5 lines?

{{< figure
width=350
align=center
src="/expandable/short.png"
>}}

We don't want to show the button when the text has not overflowed. To solve this, we need to find a way to be notified when the overflow happens and store it as a state.

Luckily, with Compose, it's easy to do. The `Text` composable exposes a `onTextLayout` parameter which is a callback that is executed when a new text layout is calculated. That callback will receive a `TextLayoutResult` object, from which we will be able to get all the necessary information:

```kotlin
@Composable
private fun ExpandableText(modifier: Modifier) {
    var textLayoutResult by remember { mutableStateOf<TextLayoutResult?>(null) }
    val isExpandable by remember { derivedStateOf { textLayoutResult?.didOverflowHeight ?: false } }

    // ...
    Text(
        // ...
        onTextLayout = { textLayoutResult = it }
    )
}
```

We pass a lambda to the `onTextLayout` parameter, which will save a new `TextLayoutResult` object every time it changes into our `textLayoutResult` state. 

Additionally, we define a derived state called `isExpandable` that will be recalculated every time the `textLayoutResult?.didOverflowHeight` changes. When it returns true, it means the text occupies more than 5 lines. 

> We used derived state here because the `isExpandable` is never modified on its own. This state is always calculated based on the value of the `textLayoutResult` state. To learn more about derived states, [check the documentation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/side-effects#derivedstateof).

Now, since we know when the text overflows, we can add another derived state that will control the visibility of the button:

```kotlin
@Composable
private fun ExpandableText(modifier: Modifier) {
    val isButtonShown by remember { derivedStateOf { isExpandable || isExpanded } }

    // ...
    if (isButtonShown) {
        TextButton(
            // ...
        ) {
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```

This logic basically means that we only want to show the button when the text has overflowed (to be able to expand it) or when it's already expanded (to be able to collapse it).

Finally, the only thing that's missing is the animation, which we can add using a single modifier on our `Text` - `animateContentSize()`:

```kotlin
@Composable
private fun ExpandableText(modifier: Modifier) {
    // ...
    Text(
        // ...
        modifier = Modifier.animateContentSize(),
    )
}
```

And with that change, we get the desired effect after running the app!

Here's the full code:

```kotlin
class MainActivity : ComponentActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

        setContent {
            ExpandableTextTheme {
                Surface(
                    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize(),
                    color = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.background
                ) {
                    ExpandableText(
                        modifier = Modifier.padding(16.dp)
                    )
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

@Composable
private fun ExpandableText(modifier: Modifier) {
    var textLayoutResult by remember { mutableStateOf<TextLayoutResult?>(null) }
    val isExpandable by remember { derivedStateOf { textLayoutResult?.didOverflowHeight ?: false } }
    var isExpanded by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }
    val isButtonShown by remember { derivedStateOf { isExpandable || isExpanded } }

    Column(
        modifier = modifier
    ) {
        Text(
            text = "Hello World! ".repeat(50),
            modifier = Modifier.animateContentSize(),
            maxLines = if (isExpanded) Int.MAX_VALUE else 5,
            overflow = TextOverflow.Ellipsis,
            onTextLayout = { textLayoutResult = it }
        )

        if (isButtonShown) {
            TextButton(
                onClick = { isExpanded = !isExpanded },
                modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth(),
                shape = RectangleShape
            ) {
                Text(
                    text = (if (isExpanded) "Collapse" else "Expand").uppercase()
                )
            }
        }
    }
}
```
